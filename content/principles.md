It's helpful to think of my life as if it were a game, in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same problem in the future.

### Be a hyperrealist

拥抱现实，做一个现实主义的人，而不是理想主义者。

Most people fight seeing what's true when it's not what they want it to be. That's bad, because it's more important to understand and deal with the bad stuff since the good stuff will take care of itself.

### Be radically open-minded and radically transparent

Being radically transparent rather than more guarded expose one to criticism. But don't let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.

Learning to be radically transparent is like learning to speak in public: While it's initially awkward, the more you do it, the more comfortable you will be with it.

### Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward

### Understand nature's practical lessons

- It's a fundamental law of the nature that *in order to gain strength one has to push one's limit*, which is painful.
- Man needs difficulties, they are necessary for hearth.

### Pain + Reflection = Progress

- Identifying, accepting, and learning how to deal with your weaknesses.
- Preferring that the people around you be honest with you.
- Being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong when you are weak.

### Own your outcomes.
You will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complianing about being beyond your control.

### Go above yourself to see things objectively

### Use 5-step to get what you want out of life
- Have clear goals.
- Identify and don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way.
- Accurately diagonse the problems to get at their root causes.
- Design plans that will get you around them.
- Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results.
