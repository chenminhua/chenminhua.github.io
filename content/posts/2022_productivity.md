### Principles of Successful Planning

- Recognize that your planning is a series of promises you're making to yourself about what you're going to do.
- Map out your projects and tasks to a sufficient level so that when the time comes, you're not thinking about how to do it, but rather are doing it.
- Design your system with a humane understanding of the constraints on your time and emotional energy, so that your work doesn't deplete you.
- If your goal is to be productive, define for yourself what that means.
