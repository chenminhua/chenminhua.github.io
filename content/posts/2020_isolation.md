John Lennon《Isolation》的最后写到「你不必受到责怪，你也不过是一个普通人类，一个疯狂世界的受害者。我们害怕每一个人，害怕阳光。太阳永远不会消失，可留给这个世界的时间已经不多了。」

> People say we got it made,
>
> don't they know we're so afraid?
>
> Isolation.
>
> We're afraid to be alone,
>
> Everybody got to have a home,
>
> Isolation.
>
> Just a boy and a little girl,
>
> Trying to change the whole wide world,
>
> Isolation.
>
> The world is just a little town,
>
> Everybody trying to put us down,
>
> Isolation.
>
> I don't expect you to understand,
>
> after you've caused so much pain.
>
> But then again, you're not to blame,
>
> you're just a human,
>
> a victim of the insane.
>
> We're afraid of everyone,
>
> afraid of the sun,
>
> Isolation.
>
> The sun will never disappear,
>
> but the world may not have many years,
>
> Isolation.
