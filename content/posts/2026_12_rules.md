去年，在我儿子出生的前几天，我看到了 Jordan Peterson 的一个演讲，内容就是他的书《人生十二法则》。老爷子的演讲风趣幽默，又和蔼可亲。你能感觉到，他是真的希望你能过好自己的一生。最近又翻出他的书来看，每一条 rule 都简单朴实又振聋发聩。

### **1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back**
  
Your posture signals to yourself (and others) that you are ready to face challenges and take responsibility.

### **2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping**

People often care for others better than they care for themselves. Give yourself the same attention and compassion.

### **3. Make friends with people who want the best for you**

Avoid those who drag you down or envy you. Surround yourself with people who genuinely support your growth.

### **4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today**

Progress is personal. Benchmark against your own improvement, not others’ achievements.

### **5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them**

Set boundaries and teach responsibility. Over-permissive parenting harms children in the long run.

### **6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world**

Before blaming society or the world, fix your own life: habits, relationships, health, responsibilities.

### **7. Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)**

Choose long-term meaning over short-term comfort or convenience.

### **8. Tell the truth — or at least, don’t lie**

Dishonesty distorts reality and creates chaos. Truth aligns your actions with reality.

### **9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t**

Listen with humility. Real understanding requires genuine attention.

### **10. Be precise in your speech**

Define your problems clearly. Vague language leads to vague thinking.

### **11. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding**

People need exposure to risk to grow strong. Overprotection weakens them.

### **12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street**

Life is full of suffering. Learn to notice small moments of beauty and peace.
