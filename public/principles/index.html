<h3 id="be-a-hyperrealist">Be a hyperrealist</h3>
<p>拥抱现实，做一个现实主义的人，而不是理想主义者。</p>
<p>Most people fight seeing what&rsquo;s true when it&rsquo;s not what they want it to be. That&rsquo;s bad, because it&rsquo;s more important to understand and deal with the bad stuff since the good stuff will take care of itself.</p>
<h3 id="be-radically-open-minded-and-radically-transparent">Be radically open-minded and radically transparent</h3>
<p>Being radically transparent rather than more guarded expose one to criticism. But don&rsquo;t let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.</p>
<p>Learning to be radically transparent is like learning to speak in public: While it&rsquo;s initially awkward, the more you do it, the more comfortable you will be with it.</p>
<h3 id="evolving-is-lifes-greatest-accomplishment-and-its-greatest-reward">Evolving is life&rsquo;s greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward</h3>
<h3 id="understand-natures-practical-lessons">Understand nature&rsquo;s practical lessons</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a fundamental law of the nature that <em>in order to gain strength one has to push one&rsquo;s limit</em>, which is painful.</li>
<li>Man needs difficulties, they are necessary for hearth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pain--reflection--progress">Pain + Reflection = Progress</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identifying, accepting, and learning how to deal with your weaknesses.</li>
<li>Preferring that the people around you be honest with you.</li>
<li>Being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong when you are weak.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="own-your-outcomes">Own your outcomes.</h3>
<p>You will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complianing about being beyond your control.</p>
<h3 id="go-above-yourself-to-see-things-objectively">Go above yourself to see things objectively</h3>
<h3 id="use-5-step-to-get-what-you-want-out-of-life">Use 5-step to get what you want out of life</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have clear goals.</li>
<li>Identify and don&rsquo;t tolerate the problems that stand in the way.</li>
<li>Accurately diagonse the problems to get at their root causes.</li>
<li>Design plans that will get you around them.</li>
<li>Do what&rsquo;s necessary to push these designs through to results.</li>
